# Touchscreen FestiPlugs

For my Passion Project, I created an interactive screen using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I refer to it as an interactive screen because it can be likened to an ordering screen at McDonald's or JD, representing a similar concept. I chose to work on this project to enhance my programming skills and delve into creating animations using CSS and JavaScript. To achieve this, I dedicated time to programming regularly and sought guidance through tutorials on YouTube, Stack Overflow, and other resources.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone [https://git.fhict.nl/I507960/touchscreen-festiplugs.git]

2. **Navigate through the Pages:**
   Start with launchpage.html to initiate the FestiPlugs screen.
   Proceed to home.html after launching to explore the home screen.

3. **Explore sections:**
   Move to sizes.html to choose from four different sizes of FestiPlugs.
   Continue to colors.html to customize FestiPlugs with various color options.
   
4. **Payment process:**
   Complete the customization by going to pay.html for payment.

5. **Final confirmation**
   Check the completed.html page to confirm the successful completion of the FestiPlugs customization process.
